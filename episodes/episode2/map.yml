                body: We have a facility loaded up with juicy <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a> that the bots can't wait to get their hands on. An attacker can destroy or compromise any  <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a> they have physical access to, so our first job is to physically protect them. Let’s fire up the simulator to illustrate a physical attack.
