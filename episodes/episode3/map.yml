                body: Even the best prepared security perimeters can be breached, so the <a data-label="cip">CIP Standards</a> require that we turn each asset into a veritable fortress. Multiple extra levels of defense guarantee that if the enemy ever gets inside a perimeter, they will still have an oily battle ahead of them. <br/><br/>The simulator will illustrate how an attacker can connect to an asset even with a strong <a data-label="psp">PSP</a> and <a data-label="esp">ESP</a> in place.

                title: Port Security
                body: As you can see, many attacks happen when someone plugs a compromised USB drive or cell phone into a physical port on a <a data-label="crca">CRCA</a>, bypassing our perimeter defenses. We protect an asset's physical ports from accidental plug-ins through physical locks, tamper tape, or similar methods. <br/><br/>In addition, just like we added a firewall to control electronic communication into the <a data-label="esp">ESP</a>, we install software firewalls (or similar protections) on <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a> to deny unauthorized electronic communication with that asset. <br/><br/>Technical <a data-label="defenders">Defenders</a> typically install these protections, but everyone must be vigilant not to go around them.

                body: The software installed on our <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a> often have security flaws that our enemies will use to launch attacks. Most software companies provide updates called "patches" that fix these flaws as they are discovered, so we regularly check for and install security-related patches for all software on our <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a>, including the operating system, control system software, or your Global Robo-Nuclear War&#8482; game. <br/><br/>We assess new patches at least once every 35 days, and install them on assets within 35 days of assessment. Patches that cause system reliability issues can be skipped if a mitigation plan is created.

The robots and their allies are constantly creating new malware, so we must regularly update our anti-virus software to detect the latest threats. There are other <a data-label="cip">CIP</a>-compliant ways to protect against malware, but anti-virus is very common.
