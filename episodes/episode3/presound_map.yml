                body: Even the best prepared security perimeters can be breached, so the <a data-label="cip">CIP Standards</a> require that we turn each asset into a veritable fortress. Multiple extra levels of defense guarantee that if the enemy ever gets inside a perimeter, they will still have an oily battle ahead of them. <br/><br/>The simulator will illustrate how an attacker can connect to an asset even with a strong <a data-label="psp">PSP</a> and <a data-label="esp">ESP</a> in place.

                title: Port Security
                body: As you can see, many attacks happen when someone plugs a compromised USB drive or cell phone into a physical port on a <a data-label="crca">CRCA</a>, bypassing our perimeter defenses. We protect an asset's physical ports from accidental plug-ins through physical locks, tamper tape, or similar methods. <br/><br/>Just like we added a firewall to control electronic communication into the <a data-label="esp">ESP</a>, we install software firewalls (or similar protections) on <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a> to deny unauthorized electronic communication with that asset. <br/><br/>Technical <a data-label="defenders">Defenders</a> typically install these protections, but everyone must be vigilant not to go around them.

Patches that cause system reliability issues can be skipped if a mitigation plan is created.

                body: A common goal of attackers is to get a software virus or other malicious code (called malware) installed on a <a data-label="crca">CRCA</a>, so we install antivirus software on each asset that identifies and removes malware. The robots and their allies are constantly creating new malware, so we must regularly update our anti-virus software to detect the latest threats. There are other <a data-label="cip">CIP</a>-compliant ways to protect against malware, but anti-virus is very common.
