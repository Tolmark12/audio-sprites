This is a big job, so this manager will delegate responsibilities to <a data-label="defenders" class="new">Defenders</a> in the facilities to perform. <br/><br/>Let's add some of these Defenders to our facility.

If an auditor learned of this, we'd likely be issued a Violation. Violations can come with big fines, up to &#36;1,000,000 per day, per incident. Youch! <br/><br/>So when we violate a <a data-label="cip">CIP</a> requirement, it's always better to issue a <a data-label="self-report" class="new">Self-Report</a> to our regulator and fix our internal processes so the issue won't happen again. We still may receive a violation, but regulators look more favorably when we catch and fix our own problems. <br/><br/>Since this incident, all Defenders have received BCSI security training. Let's see if this helps avoid a violation.

                body: Nice job, Cadet. Our facility is built, we tagged <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a> and <a data-label="bcsi">BCSI</a> locations, learned about the <a data-label="manager">CIP Senior Manager</a> and the <a data-label="cyber_security_program">Cyber Security Program</a>, and added <a data-label="defenders">Defenders</a>.
