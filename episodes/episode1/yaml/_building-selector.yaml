        subTitle: The <a data-label="cip">Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)</a> Standards require that we protect significant facilities on the <a data-label="bes">Bulk Electric System (BES)</a>. We classify our facilities in three categories.<ol><li><a data-label="high" class="new">High Impact</a> are big control centers</li><li><a data-label="medium" class="new">Medium Impact</a> are large substations and generation plants; and small control centers </li><li><a data-label="low" class="new">Low Impact</a> are everything else.</li></ol>Please add a Medium Impact facility to the simulator. Pick whichever one you like! We'll teach the same principles with any choice.

            details: "A large substation critical to the operation of the Bulk Electric System - it even has a small control room. That large circuit breaker makes me tingly all over! <br/><br/>Work location of some of the hottest workers this side of the interconnection."

            details: "Controls critical substations and generation plants and houses the Energy Management System. This particular center also operates a sweet anti-spacecraft Tesla Cannon, critical to the defense of the BES from the bots. With this setup you could run a killer game of tic-tac-toe or Global Thermonuclear War."
