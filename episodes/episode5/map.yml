                body: Given enough effort, any moat can be bridged and any wall breached if defenders aren't ready to repel the enemy. This episode is about how we detect and respond to <a data-label="cyber_security_incident" class="new">Cyber Security Incidents</a> - actual attacks against our infrastructure.

                title: Keep a Sharp Lookout
                body: All Defenders must be on the lookout for shady persons photographing our facilities, attempting to gain information via phone, email or other means, and doing otherwise shifty things. Disappearance of vehicle passes, personnel identification, uniforms, or <a data-label="bcsi">BCSI</a> is also suspicious. <br/><br/>Further, if you have <a data-label="electronic_access">Electronic Access</a> to <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a>, keep an eye out for anything that doesn't seem right on your system. This includes windows or messages that you don't recognize, unusual system slowdowns, files out of place, or otherwise strange system behavior. <br/><br/>Report any of these promptly because an attack may be in progress.

                title: Local and National Response
                body: When our monitoring efforts detect an attack, the <a data-label="cip">Standards</a> require that we convene an <a data-label="team" class="new">Incident Response Team</a> to coordinate our efforts to repel the attackers and a <a data-label="csirp" class="new">Incident Response Plan</a> with processes that ensure we handle an attack swiftly and effectively. <br/><br/>An incursion on our territory might be part of a larger, coordinated attack against the <a data-label="bes">Bulk Electric System</a>, so our Incident Response Team must promptly report significant incidents to <a data-label="eisac" class="new">E-ISAC</a>, the organization that coordinates response to attacks at the national level.

                title: Maintaining Readiness
                body: We must test our <a data-label="csirp">Incident Response Plan</a> yearly with a simulation and use our lessons-learned to improve the plan. Other events may cause the <a data-label="csirp">Plan</a> to change - like employees moving out of roles - so we must keep the information in the plan up-to-date.

                title: No Need for Simulation
                body: Many of us will have defined roles on the <a data-label="team">Incident Response Team</a>, help approve the <a data-label="csirp">Incident Response Plan</a>, or be involved in yearly testing. During an actual attack, any <a data-label="defenders">Defender</a> may be called upon for support, so we must all be ready. <br/><br/>Our facility Defenders have already been detecting and responding to <a data-label="cyber_security_incident">Cyber Security Incidents</a> in each simulated attack, so we'll skip the simulator for this chapter.

The Recovery Plan defines the data backups, spare equipment and parts, and steps needed to restore each type of <a data-label="crca">CRCA<a/>. The Plan also guides Defenders on how to preserve forensic data from the attack useful for subsequent investigations. <br/><br/>We are expected to keep our Recovery Plan up-to-date and test it yearly, often concurrently with the yearly test of our <a data-label="csirp">Incident Response Plan</a>. We must also regularly test that our data backups are working and usable for recovery purposes.
