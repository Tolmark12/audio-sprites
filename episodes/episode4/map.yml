This effectively cuts the person off from our facilities and CRCAs. Any user accounts must be completely removed and shared passwords they know changed within 30 days.

                body: After our new operator was approved for access, Richard created a <a data-label="user_account" class="new">User Account</a> for Cindy that gave her <a data-label="electronic_access">Electronic Access</a> to use the control system software on her workstation. When Cindy logs in each morning, she enters a username and password for this user account to validate her identity and access the system. <br/><br/>The robots would love to learn Cindy's username and password, so we must protect her <a data-label="user_account">User Account</a>. This chapter teaches the defenses that keep these accounts from falling into the metallic hands of the robots.

                body: To make Cindy's password hard for the bots to guess, our passwords must have a minimum length and complexity to ensure they are difficult to guess. However, even with a complex password, robots can use special tools to perform a <a data-label="brute" class="new">Brute-Force Attack</a> where they rapidly try many millions of usernames and passwords until they find a match. Let's see a <a data-label="brute">Brute-Force Attack</a> in action against Cindy's account.
